# Basic Workflow

1. Select all parts and add **standard** ArtMesh to them. I may adjust the ArtMesh to heavy or light, or, customize it by hand as fit when working on the model.
2. Create a Texture Atlas by clicking Command + T on Mac.
3. Set up clipping masks on parts like eyes \(irises clipped to eye whites\).
4. Manually redraw the ArtMesh of parts like eyelashes, eyebrows, closed mouth, so that the ArtMeshes are made up of nice-looking triangles.
5. Set up the deformer hierarchy before setting any parameters. See the page on Deformer Hierarchy for details.
6. \(Optional\) Create two ArtMesh Collision Detection Areas, one on the head and one on the body \(excluding the head\). See the page on ArtMesh Collision Detection for details. I might need to recreate the Texture Atlas after this step.
7.
